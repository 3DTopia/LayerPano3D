# Confidence based Differential Gaussian Rasterization

**Feature**:
1. Set a confidence score for each Gaussian and scale gradient with the confidence scores.
2. Implement depth and alpha rendering.

**Acknowledge**: Thanks to the [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization) and [DreamGaussian](https://github.com/ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization). 

```python
raster_settings = GaussianRasterizationSettings(
    image_height=int(viewpoint_camera.image_height),
    ...
    confidence=confidence
)

rasterizer = GaussianRasterizer(raster_settings=raster_settings)

rendered_image, radii, rendered_depth, rendered_alpha = rasterizer(
    means3D=means3D,
    ...
    cov3D_precomp=cov3D_precomp,
)
```


Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields". If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us.
